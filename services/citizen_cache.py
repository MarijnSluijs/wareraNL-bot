        inactive players (``isActive: false``) from its paginated results, even

        ``full_fetcher.fetch_missing_owner_citizenships``); this method does no
        discovery of its own and does not prune anything, since it only ever
        touches the exact rows it was asked about.

        This is also the only path that ever writes ``is_active = False``:
        the per-country sweep in :meth:`refresh_country` can't, because
        ``user.getUsersByCountry`` never returns inactive players to begin
        with. Once written, :meth:`Database.prune_stale_citizens` leaves
        inactive rows alone, so — unlike active citizens — an inactive owner
