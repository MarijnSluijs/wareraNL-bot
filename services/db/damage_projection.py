"""Database mixin for the Nigeria bot's /damage-projection command.

Two tables, both piggybacked on work the fetcher already does every hour:

``alliance_countries``
    Written from a single ``alliance.getManyPaginated`` call (the whole game
    currently has ~12 alliances / ~133 alliance-country pairs, so this is one
    cheap request per sweep).

``citizen_combat_state``
    Current health/hunger per citizen. Populated inside the *existing* hourly
    citizen sweep (:class:`services.citizen_cache.CitizenCache`), which already
    fetches ``user.getUserLite`` for every citizen in the game — the response
    already carries ``skills.health`` / ``skills.hunger``, it just wasn't being
    persisted before. No extra API calls.

Skill-mode (eco/war) comes from the existing ``citizen_levels.skill_mode``
column, and buff/debuff timing from the existing ``citizen_pill_tracking``
table — both already filled in by the same sweep, game-wide. So the only
genuinely new fetching this feature needs is the alliance list.
