"""Find tRPC procedures WarEra's frontend calls that our local openapi.json is missing.

WarEra's own published OpenAPI spec (https://api2.warera.io/openapi.json) is
stale and not kept up to date by the developer — diffing against it misses
most real endpoints (confirmed: it doesn't even list the four work.getStats*
endpoints we already know about). So instead this reverse-engineers the
actual frontend at https://app.warera.io/:

  1. Fetch the homepage to find the current Next.js build's chunk manifest.
  2. Download every JS chunk referenced by any page.
  3. Regex out tRPC call sites: `<router>.<procedure>.useQuery(`,
     `.useMutation(`, `.useSuspenseQuery(`, `.useInfiniteQuery(`, etc. tRPC's
     client is a Proxy, so these router/procedure names survive minification
     as literal property accesses in the bundled JS even though the full
     dotted path is never a string literal anywhere.
  4. Diff the discovered procedures against openapi.json.

Only fetches static JS assets from WarEra's CDN — never calls their tRPC API,
so this is safe to run as often as you like without looking like API abuse.

Queries and mutations are reported separately: queries are read-only and
reasonable to add to /api-explorer's live-test page; mutations are
side-effecting (they'd actually DO things like open a case or spend gems) and
should essentially never be added there — reported for awareness only.

A lot of what turns up is WarEra's own internal admin/moderation surface
(adminLog, banword, blacklistedIp, userAdminRights, ...) which our API key
has no access to. This script does not try to filter that out — it's a
judgment call for whoever reviews the report, not something to guess at
programmatically.

Run monthly:

    python scan_warera_endpoints.py

Pass --verify to also live-check each new query candidate against WarEra's
API using our own keys (the master key pool, falling back to the dedicated
premium pool for anything that comes back "Premium required") and sort
results into allowed / premium-only / blocked / not-a-real-endpoint. Uses
the master pool rather than any one service's dedicated key slice, spread
across keys with a delay between calls, so it doesn't eat into the rate
limit budget any live service (website, discord bot) depends on:

    python scan_warera_endpoints.py --verify
